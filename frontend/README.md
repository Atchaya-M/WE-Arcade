# Asokan's Game

Welcome to Asokan's Game, a one-of-a-kind coding platform that blends programming challenges with the thrill of a game. It’s designed to make coding fun, interactive, and exciting.

## What Makes It Unique?

Asokan's Game takes inspiration from the "Squid Game", specifically the "Red Light, Green Light" game, and adds it to the coding experience. Here's how it works:

- **Coding Meets Gaming**:

  - Users solve programming challenges by writing code in their preferred language.
  - When you run your code, the game begins. For every test case that passes, your player moves closer to the finish line.
  - If a test case fails, your player is eliminated (visualized as being "shot").

- **Exciting Visuals**:  
  The platform includes animations to show your progress, making the experience more engaging and keeping you motivated to write better code.

- **Multi-Language Support**:  
  Code in various programming languages, so you can work with what you’re most comfortable with or explore new ones.

## Why Use This Platform?

This isn’t just another coding platform. It’s a place where learning and fun go hand-in-hand. The unique gameplay makes solving problems feel less like work and more like an exciting challenge.
